The Hackathon Project for Future of Work

# High Level Design
- Project Management tools e.g. Todo-list
- Orders of completion of each item is automatically captured and included as part of the final report
- The final report, added tags, is able to get pushed into the company-wise knowledge base
- The knowledge base is deeply searchable and minable, enabling matching opportunities of mentors and projects
